# Recipe Inspiration App

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis as a two-days solo project.
It's a single page app build in Nuxt.js Vuetify.js that allows you to search for recipes by ingredients, health-issues and diet.

## Installation

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
